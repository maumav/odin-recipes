# odin-recipes
My first Odin Project!
Hello Odin!

Intro

This project is about building a recipe website using HTML. A simple homepage will showcase additional links directing to three pages containning the recipes.


This project will showcase HTML skills I have learned by putting it into practice. Additionally, git and terminal skills are also put into practice behind the scenes. 

What skills did I demonstrate in my completed project?
