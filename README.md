# odin-recipes
My first Odin Project!
Hello Odin!

Intro

This project is about building a recipe website using HTML. A simple homepage will include additional links directing to three pages containning the recipes.


This project will showcase HTML skills I have learned by putting it into practice. Additionally, git and terminal skills are also put into practice behind the scenes. 

What skills did I demonstrate in my completed project?
My project demonstrates:

i. creating functioning html pages. 
ii. providing links to each of the three recipe pages with corresponding titles
iii. accesibility by including alternative text to images to assist visually impaired users with screen-reader devices
iv. unordered list and ordered list format
v.uploading images via link using image element with source attribute
vi. an easy flow of readability and by using proper title and header placement and header hierarchy

For github and git related skills, my completed project demonstrates (behind the scenes):

i. publishing my project using git into github
ii. the use of git commits for each addition or edits on a file
iii. navigating local directory by terminal and git to create files
