# odin-recipes
My first Odin Project!
Hello Odin!

Intro

This project is about building a recipe website using HTML. Index page as the main page will be the main website with additional links directing to other recipes.


This project will showcase HTML skills I have learned as well as git and terminal related skills.

What skills did I demonstrate in my completed project?
